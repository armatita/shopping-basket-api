# SHOBA API

Minimal API for a "sho"pping "ba"sket API with data analysis.


# Technical assignment (Description)

Youâ€™re working on an online shopping platform. The sales team wants to know which items were added to a basket, but removed before checkout. We will use this data later for targeted discounts.

Using PHP, build a shopping basket that helps you get this data.

**Minimal requirements**

* Use PHP (Python will be used as requested by recruiter)

**Scope**

* Focus on API side, not on the interface
